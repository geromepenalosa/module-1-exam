                    <p>With the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other African country (including Egypt), Ethiopia is a hidden gem that is overlooked by many travellers. With such cultural diversity, archaeological pedigree and natural beauty, there's a good reason why its a so high on the Wild Frontiers travel list.
    
                    From our years of experience travelling in Ethiopia, we have pulled together what we think are the best places to visit in Ethiopia. So, let us jump into it.</p>

                        Awash<br>National Park
                    </span> <br>
                    This scenic national park is situated in the dry acacia savanna of the Rift Valley some 200km from Addis Ababa. A magnificent 150m-deep gorge, carved by the Awash River, forms the southern boundary of the park, including a substantial waterfall. To the north, you'll see the ragged edges of Mount Fantelle, a dormant volcano whose crater towers above the surrounding bush. 

                    Other highlights include the Filwoha Hot Springs, which feed a series of beautiful translucent blue pools and Lake Beseka. Although 80 mammal species have been recorded in Awash, the game viewing is less of an attraction than the scenery and birdlife. Awash National Park is regarded as one Ethiopia's top birding destinations, with over 450 species. Including the endemic yellow-throated serin and the Ethiopian cliff swallow.

                        Dannakil Depression
                    </span> <br>
                    The Danakil Depression is found in Northern Ethiopia, close to the border with Eritrea. With parts of Danakil 100 metres below sea level, this is one of the lowest places on Earth and also one of the hottest in average yearly temperature. Access is difficult as the area is only passable for 4x4 vehicles and accommodation is scarce meaning visitors camp each night at fixed sites. Arguably one of the best places to visit in Ethiopia, those that do make the journey are rewarded with some of the most extraordinary landscapes anywhere on earth. 

                    Two active volcanoes, Mount Ayalu and Erta Ale have large lava lakes, whilst the Dallol Sulphur Springs is a photographers' dream. The Awash River ends in a huge salt mine, where workers carve rough-hewn blocks of salt for sale, an extraordinary sight to behold.

                    </span> <br>
                    Up until the beginning of the 17th century, Ethiopia had what was locally referred to as a 'mobile capital'. But in 1632 Fasilidas took the throne and proclaimed Gonder as his capital, where it remained for the next 200 years. As king and emperor Fasilidas not only ushered in a period of relative calm in Abyssinia's turbulent history he also built a stupendous fort at this strategic location - added to by his successors - most of which is still intact. Wandering around the fort's spectacular turreted citadels, vast banqueting halls and bathhouses leaves you in no doubt whatsoever as to the importance of this Christian kingdom 400 years ago.

                    </span> <br>
                    The isolated town of Lalibela, situated high up in the Lasta Mountains, is famous throughout the world for its incredible rock-hewn churches. At 2,630 m and perched among wild mountains, the setting is fantastic. 

                    From the 10th to the mid-13th century it was the capital of the Zagwe Dynasty that ruled the country and it was under the direction of its most famous King, Lalibela, that the churches were carved. He gathered together the greatest craftsmen possible and some estimates think as many as 40,000 people were required to create the churches.

                    </span> <br>
                    Climbing to an altitude of 4,620m, stretching 100 miles east to west, the Simien Mountains are one of the largest ranges in Africa. With their vaulting granite columns, towering escarpments and plummeting valleys, they are also among the most spectacular. 

                    Besides the colourful Ahmaric tribes, the Simien Mountains are also home to a vast assortment of wildlife, where Gelada Baboons, the Simien fox, bushbuck and the magnificent Lammergeyer vulture can be found. But the wonder of the Simiens does not lie so much with the animals or the people that live there, it is simply to watch the sunrise or fall over a land that time forgot.
